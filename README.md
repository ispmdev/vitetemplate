# ViteTemplate Documentation

## Project Overview
ViteTemplate is a modern frontend development starter kit that combines several powerful technologies:
- Vite: A fast build tool that significantly improves development experience
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework
- SCSS: A CSS preprocessor with advanced features

## Technical Details

### Build System
Vite provides an extremely fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds. Unlike traditional bundlers, Vite leverages native ES modules during development for near-instantaneous updates.

### Component Architecture
The project follows a component-based architecture using React. Components should be organized in a logical folder structure:
- Atomic design principles are recommended (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- Each component should have its own folder with the component file, styles, and tests

### State Management
Redux is configured for global state management:
- The store is set up in src/store.ts
- Use Redux Toolkit for simplified Redux logic
- Consider using Redux Thunk or Redux Saga for asynchronous operations

### Styling Approach
The project offers multiple styling options:
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with utility classes
- SCSS for more complex styling needs
- CSS Modules for component-scoped styles

### TypeScript Integration
TypeScript provides type safety throughout the application:
- Strict mode is enabled for maximum type checking
- Create interfaces for all data structures
- Use type guards for runtime type checking

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with npm install or yarn
3. Start the development server with npm run dev or yarn dev

### Development Best Practices
- Follow the established folder structure
- Write unit tests for components and utilities
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Commit frequently with descriptive commit messages

### Building for Production
1. Run npm run build or yarn build
2. The optimized output will be in the dist/ directory
3. Test the production build with npm run preview or yarn preview

### Deployment Options
- Static hosting: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
- Server environments: Docker containers, Node.js servers
- CDN deployment: Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront

## Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
- Optimize images and assets
- Monitor bundle size with import cost tools

## Extending the Template
- Adding new dependencies: Use npm or yarn to install packages
- Configuring Vite: Modify vite.config.ts
- Tailwind customization: Edit tailwind.config.js
- Adding environment variables: Create .env files

## Troubleshooting
- HMR issues: Check for circular dependencies
- TypeScript errors: Ensure proper typing of all variables
- Build failures: Check for syntax errors and missing dependencies
- CSS conflicts: Use more specific selectors or CSS Modules
